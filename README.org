* QML TableView
** Overview
This is a simple implementation of a TableView in QML. It works with pure QML and Python models.

Although the Python models must implement the =addData()= method as a workaround for the imcompatible QML API.

The idea is this can be used as a simple table in QML and readily /wired into/ with Python / C++

*** TODO Investigate TableViewDelegate
  This seems pretty new and there's limited docs. I should circle back around
